## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When I used <section></section> instead of <div></div> for each area that needed to be called out in the CSS, my CSS styling broke and would not work. Using <div> tags instead fixed it and the CSS was properly applied.

### Continued development

Figuring when to use <section> tags vs when to use <div> tags and how to target those items when styling. I'm also interested in exploring how to create projects such as this one in an IDE like VSCode.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helps me with quick CSS styling references.
- [Codepen](https://www.codepen.io) - Easy to use editor that allows for live preview of code changes as they are made without any additional effort. Good for simple projects that don't need more than HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
